<h1>About</h1>
<p> This is my about page</p>
<p> This webpage was desinged to be much more than  what the result is. I had much better intentions for this site to be so free  flwoing, where people could learn about older, and newer cars. I chose to use European cars for my examles is becuase all cars, but espically European cars have been around for almost a century, and when you look at the cars they produce, all the parts serve a specific function. Today, that principle should always hold true. It seems Porsche has followed the rule better than almost anyone. They have great consumer loyality, and there is good reason for that. I wanted to have a huge library of cars, and I also wanted to include concept cars, for they as well shaped the automotive industry. The future for this project includes much of what I'm saying now. I wanted to incorporate more features to help make the site flow better. I just feel that cars in general are something that has a great deal of valuable knowledge. Vehicles have the incredible ability to always become faster, and overall more creative. I wanted this site to have so much more to it. I fell so short in exceution. Even looking at the HTML code, I still can not figure out why it functions the way it does. All types of cars would be on my website. If I ever had the time, I would have wanted to usdee the python code to make searching for images eaiser. The automotive industry, and its cars deserve the time to be more carefully looked at and appreciated. I wanted this site to have so much more to it. I fell so short in exceution.
